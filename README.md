The Library Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to
streamline and automate various aspects of managing a library. This project focuses on
creating a database-driven Library Management System to efficiently manage books,
members, and transactions within a library environment.
The Library Management System consists of three main entities: Books, Members, and
Transactions. The Books entity contains information about each book in the library,
including its title, author, genre, publication year, and availability status. The Members
entity stores details about library members, such as their names, email addresses, and
phone numbers. The Transactions entity records all borrowing and returning activities,
tracking the relationships between books and members, along with the corresponding dates.
